## Parameters for 3D-printing

Print in PETG or similarly heat-resistant material.  
The top and bottom shell of the enclosure need to be printed on a 0.4mm nozzle printer with a layer height of 0.2-0.23mm. The PogoHolder (the spacer in between PCB and Raspberry Pi Zero) needs to be printed with a 0.25mm nozzle.  
4 perimeters and an infill of 15% are reasonable.   

Avoid the color black, PETG temperatures after a few hours in the sun:
  * black: 50°C
  * dark gray: 45°C
  * white: 32°C
