title: About the camera kit
---

The Digital Solargraphy camera is the indirect result of a very unreliable scanner and an incredible amount of frustation with 4x5 negatives. Eventually culminating in the sale of half a dozen analogue cameras and a journey of several years of looking for a way to achieve long exposures with a bit of computation and a digital camera. After I [wrote](http://volzo.de/posts/digital-solargraphy/) about my project enough people nagged me about how they can build their own camera to convince me to redesign the hardware and software in a way that other people can assemble it themselves and do something interesting with it.

# Frequently (and infrequently) Asked Questions:  

### Can I manufacture it completely by myself?

Yes! All necessary information including the source-files for software and hardware is on [github](https://github.com/volzotan/CompressorCam). However, you will need to source the fasteners, the PCB and components and the ND-filter (links are in the Bill of Materials).

If you did build your own, I always appreciate if you get in touch with me and show me your results!

### Can I just print the printable parts myself?

Yes, just let me know and I'll prepare a kit without printed parts, containing only electronics and fasteners (that's less expensive and maybe even easier when it comes to shipping internationally).

### Can you assemble it for me?

No. Putting it together by yourself is part of the fun and the only way to really achieve a sense of ownership (and fix things if someting is loose). Additionally I am just really lazy.

### I have a very specific need and require a bespoke solution...

That's not actually a question but get in touch with me and I'll see what's reasonable and possible. However, please keep your expectations low.

### Can I get the same results with my DSLR?

Well, depends. You need to take a normally-exposed image and an extremly underexposed image at least every 60s automatically. There may be intelligent camera triggers which theoretically could do that ([Arsenal](https://witharsenal.com/), [View](https://timelapseplus.com/pages/view), [Sony CCB-WD1](https://www.sony.com/electronics/cyber-shot-compact-cameras-other-accessories/ccb-wd1)), however, I am not aware of any that actually offer these features). Another important thing is that the camera trigger needs to be able to turn your camera off in between shots/overnight and this is a rarely found feature in any timelapse controller.
